My Solutions to LeetCode Challenges

- Focus on completing the challenge in Javascript first and then Python3.
- Afterwards, I review the discussion around the challenge and update my solutions with any new performance increasing information.
- I am also using these challenges as an opportunity to learn other languages such as Typescript, C#, Go, and Rust.
